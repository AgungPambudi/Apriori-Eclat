# Apriori and Eclat
Association Learning for Market Basket Analysis using Apriori and Eclat

The python notebooks Apriori.ipynb and Eclat.ipynb are used to analyse the market basket of 7500 customers, shopping at a grocery store during a week. The items which are frequently
bought together are identified and displayed in the order of the significance of this relationship. 

The Dataset 'Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv' can be downloaded from the repository. It is also available as a part of the Machine Learning A-Z course on Udemy.
